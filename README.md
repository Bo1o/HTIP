# Hide Text In Pixels
This program can hide text in pixels, by this I mean modifying an image's pixel map in order to change color of certain pixels, and once gave to the second program it can give you back the hidden message.
The text is hidden in the bottom right corner, you can see it by pixels that are shades of black and white.

If you need to add character, simply modify the char variable ( line 3 in both file ). You need to place the character at the same place for both files.

If you have any issue with it let me know by sending me a mail to petitotjules89@gmail.com !
